          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income:</h3>
          <p>Examining census data by state, a moderate positive correlation is seen between percentage of population living in poverty 
          and lack of access to healthcare. Similarly, there is a negative correlation seen between median income and lack of healthcare 
          (generally, the higher the median income, the lower the percentage of population lacking access to healthcare). Age and access to healthcare do
          not seem correlated.</p>

          <p>Examining percentage of population living in poverty vs. percentage of smokers there is a positive correlation. There
          is negative correlation comparing median income and smoking. Age and smoking do not seem to be correlated. There appears to be some correlation 
          between poverty and obesity with positive correlation between the two, and moderate negative correlation when comparing median income to obesity.
          There does not seem to be correlation between age and obesity in this dataset.</p>

          <p>Indiana seems to rank high compared to other states in the nation in percentage of population with obesity and in percentage of smokers, regardless of
          what factor along the x-axis is chosen. The state is also fairly high in percentages of population living in poverty (around 15%) and with lack of access to 
          healthcare (also around 15%). The median income in Indiana is fairly low compared to other states and with lack of access to healthcare as well, it is not
          surprising that percentages of population with obesity or who smoke are on the high end in Indiana.</p>
